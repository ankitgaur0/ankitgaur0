**Hi, I'm Ankit Gaur 👋 🤖 👨‍💻 🇮🇳**

I'm an AI/ML engineer who is passionate about building intelligent systems with deep learning, generative AI, and RAG architectures. I love creating autonomous AI agents, exploring reinforcement learning algorithms, and bridging the gap between AI and robotics to solve real-world problems.

* 🔭 I'm working on projects at the intersection of `AI agents and RAG systems`.
* 🌱 I'm exploring `reinforcement learning`, `multi-agent systems`, and `robotics with AI`.
* 🤖 I'm building autonomous agents that can reason, plan, and execute complex tasks.
* 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on open-source AI projects, MLOps tools, and robotics initiatives.
* 🤔 I'm always eager to discuss the latest trends in AI agents, RL, and AI-powered robotics.
* ⚡ Fun fact: I believe the future is autonomous agents working alongside humans!
